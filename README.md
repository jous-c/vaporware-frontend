# Vaporware

## Overview

Vaporware is an app for you to collect things that you see online. It helps you remember them and encourages you to revisit them. 


### Problem

We consume a lot necessary and unnecessary information online everyday. Of the 50 posts I see in a day or 20 videos I save in an instagram folder, how many of those do I commit to memory? how many of those do I revisit? Maybe we don’t need to be fed new things all the time if we can’t hold onto what we’ve seen. Platforms like Youtube TikTok, Instagram or even Pinterest have features that save help you save items but they are designed for you to consume, not to digest information.
